# Blynk-Enhanced-Irrigation-System-Utilizing-IoT
This project introduces an affordable and practical agricultural irrigation monitoring system. It effectively tracks soil moisture and temperature, enabling farmers to adjust water supply to their fields accordingly. By remotely observing field data and controlling the watering pump through a user-friendly interface, farmers can significantly reduce irrigation expenses while maintaining optimal crop conditions.
